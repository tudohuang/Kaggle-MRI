# IZCC Kaggle MRI Competition Solution

## Introduction
This repository contains our solution for the IZCC Kaggle MRI competition. The aim of the competition is to predict cancer/health. We approach this problem using a ResNet-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict cancer/healthy.

## Project Setup
To run this project, follow these steps or... using the colab!

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/tudohuang/Kaggle-MRI.git
cd Kaggle-code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Describe how to use the project, including how to train the model, evaluate it, and make predictions. For example:

1. To train the model: `python train.py --data_path [path to data]`
2. To evaluate the model: `python evaluate.py --model_path [path to saved model]`
3. To make predictions: `python predict.py --model_path [path to saved model] --test_data [path to test data]`

## ResNet CNN Architecture
Provide a brief overview of the ResNet architecture and why it's suitable for this competition. Mention the specific ResNet variant used (e.g., ResNet-50, ResNet-101) and any modifications made to fit the competition's needs.

## Results
Summarize the results obtained, including any metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc. You can also include visualizations or charts if available.
